This also affords you the opportunity to not migrate Deployments, Software, Tasks, etc that are not needed anymore, and bring the source material to your Destination instance standards.</p></div><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>You may contact support for one on one review of instances, or guidance for this process</p></div><h2 id="overview" tabindex="-1">Overview <a class="header-anchor" href="#overview" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Overview&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This document goes over the ins and outs of migrating one ImmyBot instance to another. Due to how unique each instance can be, this serves to be a generic checklist that should be followed in order to ensure that the migration goes smoothly.
