## Summary of Findings

### Accurate Documentation
- All core documentation files (deployments.md, agent-installation.md, computer-onboarding.md, user-affinity.md, targets-targeting.md, deployment-resolution.md, computers-inventory.md) accurately reflect the actual implementation in the codebase
- Technical details in the documentation match the implementation in the corresponding code files
- Feature descriptions are consistent with the actual functionality available in the application
- Terminology used in the documentation matches the terms used in the codebase
- Workflows described in the documentation match the actual user experience

### Discrepancies Found
- No significant discrepancies were found between the documentation and the codebase
- All documented features exist in the actual implementation
- All documented workflows are supported by the application

### Recommendations
- The documentation is accurate and no immediate changes are needed
- Consider adding more code examples or screenshots in future documentation updates
- As new features are added to ImmyBot, ensure documentation is updated accordingly
- Consider adding more cross-references between related documentation pages

## Categorized Findings

### Critical Issues
- None found - all documented features exist in the codebase
- No instances of documentation describing functionality that doesn't exist

### Minor Issues
- None found - terminology in documentation matches the codebase
- No unclear explanations identified

### Enhancements
- Consider adding more code examples to illustrate implementation details
- Add more screenshots of the UI to enhance visual understanding
- Increase cross-references between related documentation pages
