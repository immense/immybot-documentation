# Core Concepts

This guide explains the fundamental concepts of ImmyBot that you'll need to understand to use the platform effectively. Each concept builds on the previous ones to create a comprehensive automation system.

## Deployments

Deployments are the central concept in ImmyBot. They define how computers "should be" configured.

A deployment consists of:
- **Type**: Software, Task, or Configuration
- **Content**: The specific software, task, or configuration to apply
- **Targets**: The computers, users, or groups that should receive this deployment
- **Settings**: Additional options that control how the deployment behaves

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Deployment] -->|contains| B[Type]
    A -->|contains| C[Content]
    A -->|contains| D[Targets]
    A -->|contains| E[Settings]
    D -->|can be| F[Computers]
    D -->|can be| G[Users]
    D -->|can be| H[Groups]
    D -->|can be| I[Filter Scripts]
```

Think of deployments as similar to Group Policy Objects in Windows environments, but more powerful and flexible.

> **Example**: A deployment might specify that "All accounting computers should have QuickBooks 2023 installed."

## Maintenance Sessions

Maintenance Sessions are the mechanism through which ImmyBot applies deployments to computers. When a maintenance session runs, ImmyBot:

1. Identifies all deployments that apply to the computer
2. Determines the current state of the computer
3. Creates a plan to bring the computer into compliance
4. Executes that plan as a series of maintenance actions

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Start Maintenance] --> B[Identify Deployments]
    B --> C[Check Current State]
    C --> D[Create Plan]
    D --> E[Execute Actions]
    E --> F[Report Results]
```

Maintenance sessions can be triggered:
- Manually by a technician
- Automatically on a schedule
- During computer onboarding
- Via API or integration

## Agents

The ImmyBot Agent is a lightweight service that runs on managed computers and communicates with the ImmyBot server. The agent:

- Executes commands sent from the server
- Reports computer information and status
- Manages software installations and configurations
- Runs scripts in various contexts (System, User, etc.)

There are two types of agents:
- **Full Agent**: Installed permanently on managed computers
- **Ephemeral Agent**: Temporary agent used for one-time tasks or initial setup

## Tenants

Tenants represent the organizations you manage with ImmyBot. Each tenant:
- Has its own set of computers and users
- Can have tenant-specific deployments
- May have different settings and configurations

Tenants can be organized hierarchically, with parent-child relationships that allow for inheritance of certain settings and deployments.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[MSP] -->|parent of| B[Client A]
    A -->|parent of| C[Client B]
    C -->|parent of| D[Branch Office 1]
    C -->|parent of| E[Branch Office 2]
```

## Software

In ImmyBot, software is more than just an application. A software definition includes:
- **Versions**: Different versions of the software that can be deployed
- **Detection Methods**: Scripts that determine if the software is already installed
- **Installation Scripts**: Scripts that handle the installation process
- **Configuration Scripts**: Scripts that configure the software after installation

Software can be deployed in different ways:
- **Enforced**: Always installed and kept at a specific version
- **Available**: Available for users to install on-demand
- **Removed**: Actively uninstalled if found

## Tasks

Tasks are scripts or commands that perform specific actions on computers. Unlike software deployments, tasks:
- Don't necessarily install anything
- Can be used for configuration, maintenance, or information gathering
- Can run in different contexts (System, User, Metascript, Cloud)

Tasks can be:
- **One-time**: Run once and complete
- **Recurring**: Run on a schedule
- **Compliance-based**: Run only when a computer is out of compliance

## Execution Contexts

Scripts in ImmyBot can run in different contexts, each with its own capabilities and limitations:

- **System Context**: Runs with SYSTEM privileges on the computer
- **User Context**: Runs in the context of a specific user
- **Metascript Context**: Runs on the ImmyBot server and can orchestrate actions across multiple computers
- **Cloud Context**: Runs in a cloud environment with access to cloud-specific APIs

Understanding these contexts is crucial for writing effective scripts and troubleshooting issues.

## Targets

Targets define which computers or users should receive a deployment. Targets can be based on:

- **Computer Groups**: Static or dynamic groups of computers
- **User Groups**: Groups of users, often synchronized from Azure AD
- **Filter Scripts**: PowerShell scripts that dynamically determine eligibility
- **Tenant**: All computers in a specific tenant

Targets allow for precise control over which computers receive which deployments, enabling you to create sophisticated deployment strategies.
