# Introduction to ImmyBot

ImmyBot is a comprehensive IT automation and management platform designed primarily for Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and IT departments. It streamlines the deployment, configuration, and maintenance of software across multiple clients and computers.

## What is ImmyBot?

ImmyBot is a cloud-based platform that helps IT professionals automate routine tasks, standardize deployments, and maintain consistency across their managed environments. It bridges the gap between traditional RMM (Remote Monitoring and Management) tools and modern deployment solutions.

### Key Capabilities

- **Automated Software Deployment**: Deploy software to multiple computers with consistent configurations
- **Remote Management**: Manage computers without requiring physical access
- **Integration with Popular Tools**: Connect with RMM and PSA platforms you already use
- **Targeted Deployments**: Deploy software based on sophisticated targeting rules
- **Script Execution**: Run scripts in various contexts (System, User, Cloud)
- **Inventory Management**: Maintain inventories of software and hardware
- **Streamlined Onboarding**: Simplify computer setup and configuration

## How ImmyBot Works

ImmyBot uses a lightweight agent to communicate with managed computers. The agent executes maintenance tasks, installs software, and reports back to the ImmyBot server. For computers that don't have the agent installed, ImmyBot can use ephemeral agents or integrate with RMM tools to perform tasks.

### Core Components

1. **ImmyBot Server**: The central management platform that orchestrates all activities
2. **ImmyBot Agent**: A lightweight service that runs on managed computers
3. **Deployments**: Rules that determine what software or tasks are applied to which targets
4. **Maintenance Sessions**: Scheduled or on-demand sessions that apply deployments
5. **Software Library**: A repository of software packages and configurations
6. **Maintenance Tasks**: Scripts and actions that configure systems or perform maintenance

## Why Use ImmyBot?
