# First Computer Setup

This guide walks you through the process of setting up your first computer with ImmyBot, from initial connection to successful onboarding.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- An active ImmyBot account
- Administrator access to the computer you want to set up
- A USB drive (for physical computers)

## Step 1: Create an ImmyBot USB Drive

When you first log in to ImmyBot, the Getting Started Wizard will prompt you to create an ImmyBot flash drive.

> **Important:** You only need to create this USB drive ONCE. The same drive can be used for all clients and computers. You'll select the specific client after the computer connects to ImmyBot.

1. Insert a USB drive into your computer
2. From the ImmyBot dashboard, click on **Download ImmyAgent** in the left navigation
3. Select **Create USB Drive**
4. Choose your USB drive from the dropdown menu
5. Click **Create**

## Step 2: Connect the Computer

### For Physical Computers (Recommended)

We recommend using a physical computer (Dell, HP, or Lenovo) for your first setup to experience the full capabilities of ImmyBot, including BIOS and driver updates.

1. Unbox the new computer and power it on
2. When you reach the Windows setup screen (region selection), insert your ImmyBot USB drive
3. The computer will automatically detect the ImmyBot provisioning package (PPKG)
4. Follow any on-screen prompts to apply the package

### For Virtual Machines

If you're testing with a virtual machine:

1. From the ImmyBot dashboard, click on **Download ImmyAgent**
2. Select **Create ISO**
3. Mount the ISO to your virtual machine
4. At the Windows region selection screen, press the Windows key 5 times
5. Alternatively, double-click the PPKG file from the mounted disk

## Step 3: Identify the Computer in ImmyBot

Once the provisioning package is applied, the computer will connect to ImmyBot and appear in the **New Computers** section.

1. Go to **New Computers** in the ImmyBot dashboard
2. Locate your newly connected computer in the list
3. Click on the computer to begin the onboarding process

## Step 4: Assign Customer and User

For ImmyBot to properly configure the computer, you need to specify:

1. **Customer (Required)**: The organization that owns the computer
2. **Primary User (Recommended)**: The person who will primarily use this computer

![Assign Customer and User](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1424395/173594097-f975123b-217f-42ef-aa47-2b816a5593b6.png)

> **Tip:** If this is your first time using ImmyBot, you'll only have your MSP as a customer and yourself as a user. That's fine for testing - just select these options.

> **Tip:** Customers can be imported from your RMM, PSA, or Azure integration. Users can be imported from your customers' Azure AD.

## Step 5: Start the Onboarding Session

After assigning the customer and user:

1. Click **Start Onboarding**
2. ImmyBot will create an "Onboarding" maintenance session
3. The system will automatically apply all "Recommended Deployments" to the computer
4. You can monitor the progress in real-time from the Sessions tab

## What Happens During Onboarding?

During the onboarding process, ImmyBot:

1. Installs and configures software based on your deployments
2. Applies security settings and policies
3. Configures user-specific settings for the primary user
4. Updates drivers and BIOS (for supported manufacturers)
5. Applies Windows updates

### User Profile Creation

One important aspect of the onboarding process is creating a user profile for the primary user. This allows ImmyBot to:

- Set default browser and PDF editor preferences
- Configure user-specific settings without requiring the user's password
- Apply user-level settings that are stored in the user's registry

For users synced from Azure AD, ImmyBot fetches their SID (Security Identifier) and creates their profile automatically. This works for both cloud-only users and those synced from Active Directory.

## Recommended Deployments

During onboarding, ImmyBot applies several recommended deployments that provide a solid foundation for managing your endpoints:

- **Create Profile for Primary User**: Allows ImmyBot to set default browser and PDF editors
- **Microsoft 365 Apps**: Installs the apps the selected user is licensed for
- **Manufacturer Updates**: Installs the latest updates from Dell, HP, and Lenovo
- **Adobe Reader**: Installs and configures the latest version of Adobe Reader

You can customize these deployments or create exceptions for specific clients. For more information, see [Recommended Deployments](recommended-deployments.md).

## Next Steps

After successful onboarding:

- **Review the Results**: Check the completed maintenance session for any issues
- **Add Custom Deployments**: Create your own deployments for additional software or configurations
- **Re-run the Session**: You can re-run the onboarding session as many times as needed until everything is configured to your liking

> **Tip:** To create custom deployments, go to **Deployments** in the left navigation and click **Create Deployment**.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the onboarding process:

- Check the maintenance session logs for specific error messages
- Ensure the computer has a stable internet connection
- Verify that any security software isn't blocking the ImmyBot agent
