### Your tickets
When you log into the customer portal, you'll automatically see tickets that are associated with your email address. These are tickets where you're listed as the contact or requester. You can view, reply to, and track the status of any ticket you've created or been assigned to.

### Your company's tickets
If your contact record in HubSpot is marked as a Company Ticket Admin, you can view all tickets linked to that company - not just your own. This gives you visibility into support requests from other team members at your organization. You can filter the ticket list to show only your tickets or all company tickets using the view options at the top of the ticket list.

To switch between the views, click on the view drop down and select Owned by Organization
