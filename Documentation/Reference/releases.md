## 0.72.1

Released 10/20/25

### Security Fix

- Updated the docker image which contains a fix for https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033

## 0.72.0

Released 09/24/25

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes an issue where a Filter Script could be saved / executed as a Metascript
- Fixed some grammar errors in the UI
- Fixed issue where `ISupportsExternalProviderAgentUrl` would break dynamic integration icons
- Fixed timeout issues with tenant deletion
- Fixed `RestoreComputers` API endpoint that was always returning "No computers were found to restore" when attempting to restore deleted computers
- Fixed an issue where computers excluded from maintenance couldn't run inventory scripts, even though the UI indicates inventory should still be allowed
- Fixed a PowerShell script output byte count overflow issue
- Fixed prerequisite failure messages to show readable software names (e.g., "Google Chrome") instead of technical IDs (e.g., "GlobalSoftware-307")
- Fixed an issue with maintenance sessions where sessions would get stuck in the running status forever, even after restarting Immybot.
- Fixed the alignment of integration icons in the main computer table
- Fixed off-center alignment of login page, and improved page responsiveness on smaller screensizes

- Fixed an issue where viewing change requests could incorrectly result in a 403
- Fixed an issue where the deployment preview/deploy buttons would transiently throw errors on the server

### Improvements

- Improved handling of PowerShell runspaces such that scripts should now start and end on the same thread/runspace. This will help prevent unexpected errors such as "There is no Runspace available to run scripts in this thread" from occurring.
- Implemented one-click schedule duplication. Users can now duplicate existing schedules with a single button click, creating a new disabled schedule with all original properties preserved.
- Pagination controls are now always show in tables that support it
- Updated the Maintenance Sessions page's Session Status column header filter to accept text input instead of only numeric values.
- Clicking the Update to Release button on the System Update page now shows a modal for confirmation.
- Normalized spacing and padding between table action buttons
- Made the session count panels at the top of the Maintenance Session list page have equal heights.
- On the Computer Details -> Agents tab: added a button to "View agent in external portal" for integrations supporting it.  Updated the CW Control integration to support this.
- Added more logos to the computer timeline for integration-specific events

## 0.71.1

Released 09/03/25

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where telemetry was unexpectedly getting dropped
- Fixed an issue where `Invoke-ImmyCommand -ContextString User -TerminateFromNoLoggedOnUser` would not terminate the script when no user was logged on.
- Fixed an issue where non-msp users were shown the "Can Manage Cross Tenant Deployments flag" in the UI. This flag is only available for MSP users.

## 0.71.0

Released 08/19/25

### Agent Improvements

- Implemented agent PowerShell execution host pooling to reduce script startup time
- Added ability to fully cancel running agent scripts by killing the script's PowerShell process
- Improved agent reconnection script recovery
- Added more detailed agent connection logs to Computer timeline
- Ensured agent script PowerShell processes run as 64-bit to work around SentinelOne access violation bug
- Consolidate and fix agent logs


### Other Improvements

- Added a login hint to avoid Microsoft's account selector screen when logged into multiple accounts
- Improved internal handling of rebooting computers
- When creating an integration, we now check if you have an existing integration and set the default integration name with a numeric suffix, (e.g CW Control 3). This helps avoid duplicate names and errors on submission.
 no longer suggests a duplicate name and avoids 409 errors.
- For schedules, When users toggle between "Execute Immediately After Detection" and "At a specific time", the Active Hours checkbox setting is now properly preserved. Previously, switching back to scheduled execution would lose the user's Active Hours preference.
- Enhanced the Get-ProviderAgent cmdlet to return a strongly-typed PSProviderAgent object instead of a generic dictionary, providing more consistent and reliable access to provider agent properties in PowerShell metascripts.
- Added immediate domain controller detection for newly installed agents. Domain controller badge now appears immediately after agent installation without waiting for maintenance.
- Continued development of RBAC

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a memory leak in our PowerShell runspace pool management that was leading to instance crashes after prolonged uptime
- Fixed a regression where software marked as "reboot required" weren't properly throwing errors when reboots were suppressed
- Fixed an issue when requesting access to ImmyBot where the screen would reload every 10 seconds
- Fixed an issue where items set to "Onboarding Only" and ordered before non-onboarding tasks were not respecting deployment ordering
- Fixed an issue where newly created Automate clients were syncing with an empty “Customer Name”. The mapping now checks Company for null or whitespace and, when blank, falls back to Name.
- Fixed an issue where the "Complete Azure Setup" button redirected to the wrong page
- Fixed an issue where loading a computer details page would sometimes show the error 'Cannot set properties of null (setting "inventory")'
- Fixed an issue where deleting a person would throw an error if the person was assigned as a primary user of a computer. The primary user field is now wiped out in this scenario.
- Fixed an issue where loading the script editor would consistently throw intellisense errors in the output window
- Fixed an issue where ImmyBot was incorrectly selecting x64 installers instead of ARM installers on ARM computers because it only used the "Architecture" field which shows "64-bit" for ARM64 systems

## 0.70.0

Released 07/23/25

### New Features
- Continued update to RBAC for permission checks on the server
- Enhanced enum handling in API to display enums as strings instead of integers in Swagger UI
- Computer list now auto-refreshes with selective polling and live badge sync
- Added more descriptive session logs when performing a task audit
- Significantly improved the performance of the main computer list

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where agents under the computer details page -> agents tab would show disconnected with a green (healthy) background
- Fixed session context handling for parameter validation when debugging scripts
- Fixed OAuth consent service to trim trailing slashes from redirect URIs
- Fixed issues with tenant-specific computer views for MSP users
- Fixed some incorrect access request handling and impersonation behavior
- Fixed user cache handling for multiple UPNs
- Fixed a performance issue with how we were caching authenticated users that lead to high memory in certain situations
- Fixed an issue where maintenance sessions did not follow computers when computers were moved to a different tenant

- Fixed an issue where the batch actions button was missing from the Tenant Details Page -> Sessions tab
-  Fixed an issue with trailing forward-slashes in the oauth flow consent-callback uri



## 0.69.0

Released 06/23/25

### Support Ticket Integration Capability

- A new integration capability, `ISupportsSupportTicketDetails` has been added that allows you to change where support requests are sent.
- In addition to controlling where support requests are sent, you can modify some of the branding on the support request sidebar.

The following is an example integration script:

```powershell
$Integration = New-DynamicIntegration -Init {
    param(

    )
    [OpResult]::Ok()
} -HealthCheck {
    New-HealthyResult
}

$Integration | Add-DynamicIntegrationCapability -Interface ISupportsSupportTicketDetailOverride -CreateTicket {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    [OutputType([SupportTicketCreationResult])]
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$requesterEmail,
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$subject,
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$notes,
        [string[]]$blobUrls,
        [string]$sessionUrl,
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [Immybot.Backend.Domain.Models.User]$user
    )
    try {
        Write-Verbose "Creating support ticket with subject: $subject"
        Write-Verbose "Requester email: $requesterEmail"

        $ticketData = @{
            email = $requesterEmail
            subject = $subject
            description = $notes
            attachments = $attachmentUrls
            userId = $user.Id
            userName = "$($user.FirstName) $($user.LastName)"
            # Add any other fields required by your ticketing system
        }
        Write-Output $ticketData
        # Make the API call to your ticketing system
        # This is just an example - replace with your actual API endpoint and authentication
        # $headers = @{
        #     'Authorization' = 'Bearer your-api-token'
        #     'Content-Type' = 'application/json'
        # }
        # $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'https://your-psa-system.com/api/tickets' `
        #                              -Method Post `
        #                              -Headers $headers `
        #                              -Body ($ticketData | ConvertTo-Json) `
        #                              -ErrorAction Stop

        # For this example, we'll simulate a successful ticket creation
        # In a real implementation, you would extract the ticket ID and URL from the API response
        $ticketId = [Guid]::NewGuid().ToString()
        $ticketUrl = "https://your-psa-system.com/tickets/$ticketId"

        Write-Verbose "Ticket created successfully with ID: $ticketId"

        # Create and return the result object
        $result = [SupportTicketCreationResult]::new()
        $result.Success = $true
        $result.Message = "Support ticket created successfully"
        return $result
    }
    catch {
        # Handle any errors that occur during ticket creation
        Write-Error "Error creating support ticket: $($_.Exception.Message)"

        $result = [SupportTicketCreationResult]::new()
        $result.Success = $false
        $result.Message = "Failed to create support ticket: $($_.Exception.Message)"

        return $result
    }

} -NewSupportFormBranding {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    [OutputType([DotNext.Optional[Immybot.Backend.Providers.Interfaces.ProviderSupportFormBranding]])]
    param(

    )

    # Replace the default Immybot Support Sidebar and Session Support Modal UI details with your own branding

    # Available parameters:
    # - $supportSidebarTitle: The title of the support sidebar panel
    # - $headerAlertMessage: The text residing in the alert at the top of the support sidebar panel
    # - $descriptionPlaceholderText: The placeholder text for the description field in the support form
    # - $descriptionAlertMessage: The text residing in the alert under the description field
    # - $showConfirmationCheckbox: Boolean indicating whether to show the 'I've read FAQ' confirmation checkbox
    # - $footerMessage: The text residing in the footer of the support sidebar panel
    # - $sessionSupportButtonTitle: The title of the button for the session support modal
    # - $showSessionSupportConfirmCheckbox: Boolean indicating whether to show the 'I've read the Security Software Exclusions' confirmation checkbox in the session support modal

    New-SupportFormBranding -SupportSidebarTitle 'Your Branding Request Title' `
                            -HeaderAlertMessage 'Welcome to [Brand] Customer Care!' `
                            -DescriptionPlaceholderText 'Describe your experience or issue here' `
                            -DescriptionAlertMessage 'Please provide specific details about your order, location, and time of visit to help us serve you better!' `
                            -ShowConfirmationCheckbox $false `
                            -FooterMessage 'Thank you for contacting [Brand]. We are committed to making things right!' `
                            -SessionSupportButtonTitle 'Request Help' `
                            -ShowSessionSupportConfirmCheckbox $false `
}

return $Integration
```
This would result in the the following support request sidebar:

### Improvements

- Added a notes field to the computer details overview tab. The notes also show up in the main computer list page.
- Added a "Computers" column to the tenant list page that displays the total number of computers for each tenant.
- Updated the Immy Agent integration page to no longer show the form since it can't be updated
- Continued work on implementing role-based access control on the server

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where assigning a tenant's parent could create a circular reference
- Fixed an issue where MSP non-admin users were unable to create tenants.
- Fixed an issue with cloud sessions where it would incorrectly not start the session if a computer session for that tenant was running
- Fixed an issue where onboarding sessions would occasionally show the wrong user that triggered it. This issue was related to caching and did not affect security.

## 0.68.1

Released 06/09/25

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where an integration cmdlet had a parameter removed that would cause some integrations to fail to initialize.
- Fixed an issue where ImmyBot Agent deployments could sometimes still fail with "Provider ImmyBot Agent does not have a client linked to tenant xxx"

## 0.68.0

Released 06/05/25

### Improvements
- Improved exception logging for scripts that fail preflight
- Updated the "references in deployments" section on the software, software version, and task pages to display more information
- Added back the ability to permanently delete computers. On the computer list page's deleted tab, you can now permanently delete computers through batch actions.
- Improved the styling of the software prerequisite builder

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where software deployments with a desired state of "not present" would prompt for a license. "Not present" deployments do not require a license to be specified.
- Fixed an issue with sending test emails on the SMTP form always requiring authentication
- Fixed an issue where maintenance action activities would fail to save if the activity name was over 150 characters
- Fixed an issue where the Immy agent integration was able to be deleted, causing unexpected behavior since this is not allowed
- Fixed an issue where the software prerequisite selector was too narrow
- Fixed an issue where the application could get stuck in a login loop if it was rendered inside of an iframe
- Fixed an issue with client name column filtering on the integration clients tab
- Fixed an issue with the text in the alert using the wrong color in light mode when on the integration clients tab
- Fixed an issue with an undefined exception being thrown when filtering on the Types column from the integration clients tab
- Fixed an issue where dynamic integrations supporting listing agents would overwrite the integration's preference for whether online status support was enabled. Online status support is now tied directly to running scripts which can also be disabled on the integrations page in the capabilities section.
- Fixed an issue where license files would not be found due to inconsistent download paths
- Fixed an issue where some scripts in onboarding sessions would incorrectly fail due to missing permissions if the session was triggered by a non-msp user

## 0.67.9

Released 05/28/25

### Authentication Improvements

- Enabled sliding expiration for authentication cookies to automatically renew the session while the user remains active which provides a better user experience.

### Agent Log Improvements

- Previously, the agent would put logs all over the place in subdirectories inside `/ProgramData/ImmyBot`. We've consolidated the agent's logs to all go into just a few different files in `/ProgramData/ImmyBot/Logs`.

- A fix has also been applied that prevents clobbering of ephemeral logs by multiple concurrent ephemeral agents.

### General Improvements

- The Azure group dropdown on deployments no longer returns all Azure groups by default. It now supports searching and only returns groups found within the search. This has a potentially significant performance impact for customers who have hundreds or thousands of Azure groups.
- Maintenance sessions now accurately report "time running" on the list page by accumulating the duration during which the session is actively running.  For example, if a computer goes offline during a maintenance session and comes back online 3 days later, the "time running" value will not include the 3 days the computer was offline.
- On the software page, when using a custom detection script, we now show the detection string inputs since this data is available inside of a custom detection script.
- Improved the performance of loading logs for a maintenance session which reduces the overall load time for the page.
- The computer list's pending tab now allows searching by OS name.
- On the software page, a "Depends On" column has been added to the versions grid so you can see dependencies without having to edit each version.
- We now also show canceled for any maintenance action or phase that was actively running when the session was cancelled. This will help prevent confusion about whether an action is still running when the session has been cancelled.
- The "Triggered By" filter on the sessions page now allows selecting of the "System Automatic Onboarding" or "Schedule" options when attempting to filter maintenance sessions which previously limited users' ability to filter sessions by their trigger source.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the getting started checklist and subscription details API routes were returning a 403 for non-MSP users. These routes are no longer called for non-MSP users.
- Fixed a caching issue with user impersonation where it would use stale permissions on the frontend before the cache expired a minute later.
- Fixed a caching issue with application preferences where toggling a preference related to user permissions did not take effect immediately.
- Fixed an issue where the computer overview page's "Last Boot Time" was displaying "in X hours" instead of "x hours ago".
- Fixed an issue with tenant deletion that could result in the application restarting due to an unhandled exception.
- Fixed a permission issue with script execution through the script editor.
- Fixed an issue on the landing page where the logged in user's name could show up as null.
- Fixed an issue that allowed for deletion of MSP tenants. As a safety-check, a tenant must manually first be marked as non-MSP in order to be deleted.
- Fixed an issue with the notification table not showing all notifications
- Fixed an issue on the software version page where the "Depends On" dropdown would not show all versions when creating a new version.
- Fixed an issue affecting MSP users where exporting software data to Excel from a specific tenant's view would contain data for all tenants instead of just the selected tenant.
- Fixed an issue where the navbar dropdown on mobile would incorrectly stay open when toggling the sidebar or clicking outside the dropdown.
- Fixed an issue in the technician pod where technicians could not change the selected computer
- Fixed an issue where deleted computers were still showing up in the "Computers Excluded From Maintenance" tenant preference
- Fixed an issue where the repair button of the computer software did nothing when clicked.
- Fixed an issue on the billing page where it was showing "undefined" for concurrent sessions when a user had the concurrent sessions add-on.
- Fixed an issue where computer timeline events would never load due to a poor performing sql query
- Fixed an issue where tenant admins could not create new maintenance tasks

## 0 67.8

Released 05/08/25

### Zip File Script Parameter Changes

Fixed an issue where the zip file parameter value never actually pointed to the zip file.

For example (using $Drivers as the uploaded file):

#### Original behavior

- Drivers pointed to: $($env:SystemRoot)\Temp\ImmyBot\bd09dc93-5ece-74dc-9c72-29ed855e643a\Drivers.zip (this never existed)
- DriversFolder pointed to: $($env:SystemRoot)\Temp\ImmyBot\bd09dc93-5ece-74dc-9c72-29ed855e643a

#### New behavior

- Drivers will point to: $($env:SystemRoot)\Temp\ImmyBot\bd09dc93-5ece-74dc-9c72-29ed855e643a.zip
- DriversFolder still points to: $($env:SystemRoot)\Temp\ImmyBot\bd09dc93-5ece-74dc-9c72-29ed855e643a

### Other Improvements

- Added the `TargetGroupFilter` parameter to the `Get-ImmyComputer` command when used in a filter script.
- An audit log is now added after a schedule executes. In the event of a failure to execute a schedule, a notification will be created with exception details.
- Improved the load time of the maintenance session details page

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed user access check on local script execution route
- Fixed some broken maintenance item links in the actions tab of tenants and computers
- Fixed an issue that was preventing the deployment list from loading
